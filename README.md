# CV Generate App

This project is part of TOP projects in my journey of learning ReactJS.

In this I have learned a lot about state, props. But I'm planning a second project like this but will have a preview section next to input form for more convinient and intuitive.

## Build With

**React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
**React Hooks (useState):** For managing component state and handling user input.
**Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
**HTML & JSX:** For structuring the application components.
